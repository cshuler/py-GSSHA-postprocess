As part of a related project which is being leveraged to advance the Hawaii CIROH team's ability to develop automated pipelines to run watershed models, PI Shuler is working to develop py-GSSHA-postprocess, a python-based module intended to help automate use interaction with hydrologic models. Specifically py-GSSHA-postprocess is being used to calibrate, validate and postprocess output from GSSHA-based watershed models, but this framework is similar to the Next-Gen framework and will aid in our team's adoption and use of the Next-Gen framework, once we have staffing needs met. The py-GSSHA-postprocess module is in active development here:
