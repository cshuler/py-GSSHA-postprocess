 By Christopher Shuler UH-WRRC


This is in development to create a python-based module intended to help automate use interaction with hydrologic models, specifically GSSHA models as pre-processed using WMS. Currently the code is being optomized to calibrate, validate and postprocess output from GSSHA-based watershed models
